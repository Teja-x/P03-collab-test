# collab-test

This repository is used to simulate a real-world collaboration workflow using Git and GitHub.

## Objective

To practice:

- Branch creation and management
- Making commits on feature branches
- Pushing changes to remote
- Opening and reviewing Pull Requests (PRs)
- Merging PRs into the `main` branch

## Workflow Demonstrated

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Create a new feature branch
3. Make code or content changes
4. Push the feature branch to GitHub
5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
6. Review and merge the PR into `main`

## Demo Content

This project includes small updates to the `README.md` file to simulate collaboration, but the workflow mirrors what you'd do in a real project. 
This is a simulated collaboration change

## Status

Simulated PR workflow has been successfully demonstrated.
